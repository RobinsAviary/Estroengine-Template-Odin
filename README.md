# Estroengine Project Template
This repo exists so you can easily download/clone it to start working on your own [Estroengine](https://github.com/RobinsAviary/Estroengine-Odin) project. If you want to build the program, use ``build.bat``, and if you would like to build and run the program, use ``run.bat``. The build script automatically pauses at the end, so use this if you're trying to view the output of Odin's compiler. Run automatically exits itself at the end so you will not be able to read anything unless you launch it from a command line itself. You can also just use the Odin CLI normally to build/run your project, they're only in this repo for ease-of-use.

## Docs
There's a bit more about this on the [engine repo](https://github.com/RobinsAviary/Estroengine-Odin?tab=readme-ov-file#docs), but in order to generate the ``docs.txt`` for Estroengine you just need to run ``docs.bat``.
